\begin{abstract}
Steganalysis is the science of detecting the presence of hidden messages in media. There are multiple steganalysis techniques, which usually look for the
artifacts created by the message hiding process. This tool combines metadata analysis, statistical analysis and neural networks, for the purpose of identifying
whether or not an image contains embedded messages.

\section*{File Metadata Anomalies}

Sometimes the process of steganography leaves other, more noticeable traces besides the noise in the image itself. The image has been scanned for such traces:
structural, metadata, and container anomalies that might indicate tampering or hidden data.

Examples include unusual file size, invalid file headers, missing or strange EXIF metadata, and corrupted or suspicious PNG chunks. While these are not a direct proof of
steganography, they are heuristic red flags.

\section*{RS Analysis}

RS Analysis is a statistical steganalysis technique designed to detect data hidden by LSB (least-significant bit) embedding in images. It is based on the fact that in a
non-stego image, there are certain regular statistical relationships between the different bit-planes and among neighboring pixels. By embedding a message (modifying
LSBs), these correlations are disturbed, and RS Analysis can detect these disturbances. It is effective when the cover image is a "natural image" (e.g. photos with 
natural textures and smooth areas) because those have the spatial correlations that RS exploits. In addition, the amount of data hidden needs to be sufficiently high,
since small payloads may produce a disturbance that is too subtle to reliably detect.
